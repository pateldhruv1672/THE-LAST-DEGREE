-- Indexes for Performance Optimization
-- =============================================================================

-- Note: Snowflake does not support traditional CREATE INDEX; skipping index creation.
-- If clustering is needed, consider CLUSTER BY or materialized views in a follow-up step.

-- -- =============================================================================
-- -- Views for Analytics and Reporting
-- -- =============================================================================

-- Views omitted here to avoid permission and dependency issues during initial schema creation.
-- Create views in a separate migration after grants/privileges are validated.
